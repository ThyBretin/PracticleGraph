The Big Picture (Refreshed)
The architecture doc and your notes paint a system that’s all about extracting a codebase’s story through metadata (particles) and relationships (graphs), with flexibility for full or scoped views. Here’s how it breaks down:
Particles:
What: File-level metadata—purpose, props, hooks, calls, logic, depends_on, jsx, comments, etc.

How: Generated via particle_generator.py (runs metadata_extractor.js), cached with MD5 hashes for freshness. addParticle() kicks this off for individual files.

Role: The building blocks—each file’s essence.

Graph:
What: Aggregated particles into a relational structure—nodes (files), edges (dependencies), tech_stack, state_machine, etc.

How: createGraph(path) scans a scope (all or Events), checks particle freshness, regenerates stale ones, and builds the graph. exportGraph() outputs it.

Scope: Can be full codebase (createGraph(all)) or folder-specific (createGraph(components/Features/Events)).

ParticleThis (SuperParticles):
What: User-enhanced particles—override defaults with precise metadata (e.g., from project_definition.json, soon-to-be DedicatedParticles).

How: Supersedes default particles whenever present—created before or after createGraph(), injected into the process.

Role: Your accuracy booster—ensures particles reflect intent, not just code guesses.

Export:
What: exportGraph(Events, Navigation) merges particles from multiple scopes into one graph, with a single tech_stack.

How: Pulls cached or fresh particles, aggregates them, and writes a JSON file.

Key Alignments
Scope:
You Said: createGraph(Events) limits to that folder; createGraph(all) does everything. exportGraph(Events, Navigation) merges scopes.

Sync: Yep—scope is a filter. The old system respected this, but now hardcoding (e.g., dependency_tracker.py) pulls in extra files. We need to restore tight scoping—Events means just Events.

Intent/Purpose:
You Said: Intent and purpose are the same—pick purpose and stick with it.

Sync: Got it—purpose it is. ParticleThis sets purpose (e.g., “Displays venue address”) over the default (e.g., “Handles eventlocation functionality”). No blending, just override.

ParticleThis Timing:
You Said: createGraph() generates particles and aggregates them. ParticleThis can preempt this (before graph) or refine it (after), always trumping defaults.

Sync: Perfect—ParticleThis is a wildcard. Pre-graph, it seeds custom particles. Post-graph, it swaps them in. Either way, it’s the boss.

Project Definition Rename:
You Said: Rename project_definition.json to DedicatedParticles (or SuperParticles), store it with graphs and cache in Particle-Graph.

Sync: Love it—DedicatedParticles screams purpose-built overrides. Placing it near graphs/cache makes sense—centralized, accessible.

Export Clarification:
You Said: exportGraph(Events, Navigation) merges two scopes into one graph, single tech_stack.

Sync: Crystal clear—aggregation, not separate graphs. One unified story, shared tech context.

Where We’re At
Particles: Default ones come from code parsing (metadata_extractor.js, particle_generator.py). They’re fine but generic due to hardcoding (e.g., hook mappings, rich rules).

Graph: createGraph(Events) should scope to Events, but hardcoding bloats it. exportGraph() works as intended—merging scopes.

ParticleThis: Your fix—DedicatedParticles (née project_definition.json) feeds it, overriding defaults for accuracy. Not fully wired yet.

Flow: addParticle() → createGraph() (with freshness checks) → exportGraph(). ParticleThis slots in flexibly.

What’s Off
Scope Creep: Hardcoding in dependency_tracker.py (hooks) and metadata_extractor.js (rich rules) pulls in files outside Events. Old system didn’t—let’s revert to strict path limits.

ParticleThis Integration: DedicatedParticles isn’t hooked up—purpose, props, etc., aren’t overriding defaults in the graph.

Naming: intent vs. purpose confusion—settled on purpose, but the pipeline needs to reflect that.

Sync Check
Scope: We’re aligned—createGraph(Events) should mean only Events. Fix the hardcoding creep.

ParticleThis: We’re synced—it’s the superparticle, overriding defaults, fed by DedicatedParticles. Timing’s flexible—pre or post-graph.

Purpose: Agreed—purpose rules, no intent split. DedicatedParticles sets it explicitly.

Export: On the same page—exportGraph(Events, Navigation) merges into one graph, one tech_stack.

Are we locked in? I think scope’s the urgent fix—rein it in like the old days. Then wiring ParticleThis with DedicatedParticles seals the accuracy goal. What’s your gut saying—scope first, or ParticleThis priority? Anything else clicking or missing?
