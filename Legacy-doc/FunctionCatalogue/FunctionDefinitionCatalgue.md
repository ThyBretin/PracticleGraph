Should We Fetch Function Definitions and Build a Catalogue?
Earlier Thread Context
We floated mapping all functions from main libraries (e.g., React’s useState, Axios’s get) to boost accuracy. Let’s weigh it for ParticleThis.
Pros
Accuracy Jump:
Knowing useState sets state or axios.get fetches data helps AI propose smarter intent (e.g., “get → data fetch for Location?”).

Current: Relies on name/args guessing (70-80% hit rate). Catalogue: 90-95% out the gate.

Context: 
Links library semantics to code (e.g., useNavigate → navigation flow), enriching flows/rules.

Scalability: 
Supports more libraries (e.g., Vue, Lodash) without hardcoding rules.

Cons
Effort:
Fetching: Scrape npm/docs (e.g., React docs) or parse source—days to weeks for 10-15 libraries.

Maintenance: Libraries update (e.g., React 19)—catalogue needs refresh.

Diminishing Returns:
ParticleThis already refines via chat—user fixes AI guesses. Catalogue speeds it up but isn’t essential.

Overhead: 
Big JSON catalogue (e.g., 1000s of functions) bloats runtime if not cached smartly.

Plan If Yes
Scope: Top 10 JS libraries (React, Redux, Axios, Lodash, etc.).

Fetch: 
Script: Pull from npm package exports or docs APIs (e.g., react → useState, useEffect).

Format: { "react": { "useState": "Sets local state", "useEffect": "Handles side effects" } }.

Store: src/helpers/library_catalogue.json, load via config_loader.

Use: 
particle_generator.py: Cross-check calls against catalogue.

chat_handler.py: AI uses defs for better guesses (e.g., “useState for Location state?”).

Time: 3-5 days (scrape + integrate).

My Take
Now? No: ParticleThis works fine without it—user refinement covers gaps. Start lean, test the core, add later if chat feels slow/dumb.

Later? Yes: For market polish—faster intent guesses, broader appeal (non-JS langs). Prototype first, gauge need.

Alternative: Hardcode 5-10 key functions (e.g., useState, axios.get) in chat_handler as a stopgap—1 hour vs. days.
