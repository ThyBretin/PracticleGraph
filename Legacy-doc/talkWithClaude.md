I'm building this but I need to know how an ai using mcp can load the graph generated in his "mind" for contextEditBased on your request and the documentation provided, I'll explain how an AI using MCP (Model Control Protocol) can load a Particle-Graph into its context.
The process for an AI to load a graph via MCP involves using the JSON-RPC API layer that Particle-Graph exposes. Here's how it works:
Loading a Graph via MCP
When an AI assistant needs to load a Particle-Graph for context, it would use the loadGraph function through the MCP client/host integration:

Make the API Call: The AI would issue a JSON-RPC request through MCP to the Particle-Graph Docker container:

CopyloadGraph("FeatureName")  // For a specific feature
or
CopyloadGraph("codebase")  // For the entire codebase

Path Resolution: The system's PathResolver automatically handles translating between host paths and Docker container paths, so the AI doesn't need to worry about this complexity.
Response Processing: The Particle-Graph system would return a structured response that follows the MCP standard format:

jsonCopy{
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Graph loaded successfully with 42 nodes and 156 edges"}],
  "isError": false
}

Graph Data Structure: Along with the confirmation message, the system would return the actual graph data containing:

Nodes (files with Particle data)
Edges (dependency relationships)
Tech stack information
State machine logic
Application metadata


Context Integration: The AI would then parse this graph data and incorporate it into its context understanding, allowing it to reason about the codebase without having to process all the raw source code.

Practical Example of AI Usage
Here's a practical example of how this would work in a conversation:

User: "I need help updating the Events feature in my app."
AI: "Let me load the context for your Events feature."
(Behind the scenes, the AI would call loadGraph("Events") via MCP)
AI: "I've loaded your Events feature context. I can see it uses React hooks for state management, has components like EventCard, EventList, and EventDetail, and makes API calls to /api/events. What specific updates do you need help with?"

The AI now has comprehensive knowledge of the Events feature structure, dependencies, props, and logic patterns without needing all the raw code in its context window.
Key Benefits in Practice

Token Efficiency: Instead of sending thousands of tokens of raw code to the AI, the graph representation provides concentrated, structured context
Relationship Understanding: The AI immediately understands how components connect and depend on each other
Tech Stack Awareness: The AI can tailor its suggestions to match your specific technology choices
Consistent Knowledge: Every time the AI loads the graph, it gets the same comprehensive understanding

This approach fundamentally changes how AI assistants can help with complex codebases, making them far more effective as development partners.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Tthat's good, can you tell me which file I should show you to see if the implementation is correct ?EditBased on the documentation you've provided, I should examine the load_graph.py file from the API layer to verify the correct implementation for loading a graph via MCP.
This file would contain the loadGraph() function which is the primary interface that an AI using MCP would call to load the graph into its context. According to your architecture document, this file would be located at:
Copy/Users/Thy/Particle-Graph/src/api/load_graph.py
This file would handle:

Loading graphs from cache or parsing from files
Data validation and sanitization
Formatting the response in the MCP-compatible JSON-RPC format
Converting container paths back to host paths for the response

Looking at this file would let me confirm that the implementation correctly follows the design specifications and that it properly formats the response in a way that an AI using MCP could integrate into its context.
Additionally, I might also want to look at the path_resolver.py file to ensure the path translation between host and container is working correctly, as this is critical for the MCP integration.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.load_graphpyTEditLooking at the load_graph.py implementation, I can confirm that the implementation aligns well with the architecture design for loading Particle-Graphs via MCP. Let me analyze the key aspects:
Key Implementation Details

Graph Loading Options:

The function supports loading a single feature, multiple comma-separated features, or the entire codebase with special keywords "codebase" or "all"
This flexibility allows the AI to load exactly the context it needs based on the user's request


Path Resolution:

Though not explicitly shown in this file, it imports the PathResolver which would handle the path translation between host and container systems


Cache Management:

The implementation uses a cache_manager for efficient retrieval of previously generated graphs
This ensures graphs don't need to be regenerated each time they're requested


Compressed Storage:

The graphs are stored in a compressed format using zlib to minimize storage requirements
They're properly decompressed before being returned to the caller


Token Counting:

The implementation includes token counting using tiktoken (the "cl100k_base" encoding)
This helps track how much of the AI's context window would be consumed by loading the graph


Multi-Feature Aggregation:

When loading multiple features, the code intelligently aggregates them and caches the combined result
This optimization prevents redundant processing for common combinations


Return Format:

The function returns a dictionary with the manifest and token count, suitable for JSON-RPC formatting



What's Working Well
The implementation handles:

Proper error messages for missing graphs
Token counting for context window management
Caching optimization for performance
Feature aggregation for multi-feature requests
Tech stack aggregation across features
Coverage percentage calculation

Missing MCP Integration Piece
The one thing missing from this specific file is the formatting of the response in the MCP-specific JSON-RPC format described in your architecture document:
jsonCopy{
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Operation result details"}],
  "isError": false
}
This formatting is likely handled at a higher level in the MCP integration layer, which would wrap the return value from this function in the appropriate MCP response format.
Overall, the implementation is quite solid and follows the design principles outlined in the architecture document. An AI using MCP would be able to load graphs using this implementation, assuming the MCP response formatting is handled correctly at the integration layer.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.TI tried to load the graph to claude via my ide but he says : I have access to the Particle graph data that was generated in our conversation, but it's not the complete JSON file - it was truncated in the response I received. The response shows "<truncated 8103 bytes>" in the middle, indicating that a significant portion of the JSON was cut off.
While I have some high-level information about the Events feature components and their dependencies, I don't have the complete details of all components, their implementations, or the full structure of the codebase.EditLooking at the error message you received, the issue is that the graph data is being truncated when Claude tries to load it through your IDE. This is a common problem when working with large JSON structures in chat interfaces, as there are often size limits on individual messages.
Why This Is Happening
When you try to load the Particle-Graph through your IDE to Claude, the graph data is likely being sent as part of the conversation text. Since the graph can be quite large (especially for a complete codebase), the message gets truncated with that "<truncated 8103 bytes>" marker.
Potential Solutions
Here are a few approaches you could try to solve this issue:

Implement a Summarization Layer:

Modify load_graph.py to include a "summary" mode that returns a more compact version of the graph
Focus on high-level metadata rather than all file details


Chunking Implementation:

Create a new function in your MCP integration layer that breaks the graph into manageable chunks
Something like loadGraphChunked(path, chunk_size=4000) that returns portions of the graph


Filtered Loading:

Implement a function that loads only specific aspects of the graph:
pythonCopyloadGraphFiltered(path, include=["tech_stack", "dependencies"], exclude=["file_contents"])



Feature-Based Loading:

Instead of loading the entire codebase at once, focus on loading individual features as needed
This aligns with your existing design that supports feature-specific loading


Artifact-Based Approach:

If you're using Claude with artifact support, modify the implementation to generate the graph as an artifact rather than including it in the message text



Implementation Example
Here's how you might implement a solution in load_graph.py:
pythonCopydef loadGraphSummary(path: str) -> dict:
    """
    Load a compact summary version of the graph, optimized for AI consumption.
    """
    # First get the full graph
    result = loadGraph(path)
    
    if "error" in result:
        return result
        
    # Extract just the critical information
    manifest = result["manifest"]
    summary = {
        "tech_stack": manifest.get("tech_stack", {}),
        "components": {},
        "dependencies": {},
        "stats": {
            "file_count": manifest.get("file_count", 0),
            "coverage_percentage": manifest.get("coverage_percentage", 0),
            "token_count": manifest.get("token_count", 0)
        }
    }
    
    # Extract component summaries without detailed content
    files = manifest.get("files", {})
    for feature, feature_files in files.items():
        summary["components"][feature] = {}
        for file_path, file_data in feature_files.items():
            # Include just key metadata
            summary["components"][feature][file_path] = {
                "type": file_data.get("type", "unknown"),
                "imports": file_data.get("imports", []),
                "exports": file_data.get("exports", []),
                "hooks": file_data.get("hooks", [])
            }
    
    # Get key dependency relationships
    for feature, feature_files in files.items():
        for file_path, file_data in feature_files.items():
            if "depends_on" in file_data:
                if file_path not in summary["dependencies"]:
                    summary["dependencies"][file_path] = []
                summary["dependencies"][file_path].extend(file_data["depends_on"])
    
    return {"manifest": summary, "token_count": len(tokenizer.encode(json.dumps(summary)))}
Then in your MCP integration, you'd expose this new function alongside the original one.
Would you like me to suggest any other specific changes to the implementation to address this issue?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Tthe goal of making the graph is to provide the full context to an ai, can we split teh file in multiple pieces ? Because creating the summary of the summary is not idealEditYou're absolutely right - the whole point of Particle-Graph is to provide complete context to the AI, and creating a summary would defeat that purpose. Splitting the graph into multiple pieces that can be loaded sequentially is a much better approach.
Here's how we could modify the implementation to allow for chunked loading:
Chunked Graph Loading Solution
We can add a new function to load_graph.py that splits the graph into manageable chunks:
pythonCopydef loadGraphChunked(path: str, chunk_size: int = 4000, chunk_number: int = 0, total_chunks: int = None) -> dict:
    """
    Load a Particle Graph in chunks for handling large graphs.
    
    Args:
        path: Path/feature name to load graph for
        chunk_size: Approximate size of each chunk in tokens
        chunk_number: Which chunk to return (0-indexed)
        total_chunks: Total number of chunks (if known)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Chunk of the graph with metadata about chunking
    """
    # First get the full graph
    result = loadGraph(path)
    
    if "error" in result:
        return result
        
    # Get the full manifest
    manifest = result["manifest"]
    manifest_json = json.dumps(manifest)
    
    # Calculate how many chunks we need
    tokens = tokenizer.encode(manifest_json)
    token_count = len(tokens)
    
    # Calculate chunks
    if total_chunks is None:
        total_chunks = (token_count + chunk_size - 1) // chunk_size
    
    # Validate chunk number
    if chunk_number >= total_chunks:
        return {"error": f"Invalid chunk number. Only {total_chunks} chunks available."}
    
    # Split the tokens into chunks
    chunks = []
    for i in range(0, token_count, chunk_size):
        chunks.append(tokens[i:i+chunk_size])
    
    # Get the specified chunk
    chunk_tokens = chunks[chunk_number]
    
    # Decode back to JSON
    chunk_json = tokenizer.decode(chunk_tokens)
    
    # This might not be valid JSON, so we need to handle that
    try:
        # Try to parse as JSON
        chunk_data = json.loads(chunk_json)
        is_valid_json = True
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # If it's not valid JSON, we'll return it as a text fragment
        chunk_data = chunk_json
        is_valid_json = False
    
    # Return the chunk with metadata
    return {
        "chunk": chunk_data,
        "chunk_number": chunk_number,
        "total_chunks": total_chunks,
        "is_valid_json": is_valid_json,
        "token_count": len(chunk_tokens)
    }
Implementation in MCP Client
To use this in your MCP client/IDE integration, you would:

First call loadGraphChunked with just the path to get the first chunk and total chunks:
CopyfirstChunk = loadGraphChunked("Events")
total_chunks = firstChunk["total_chunks"]

Then iterate through the chunks:
CopyfullGraph = {}
for i in range(total_chunks):
    chunk = loadGraphChunked("Events", chunk_number=i, total_chunks=total_chunks)
    # Merge chunk into fullGraph


Better Approach: File-Based Chunks
The approach above is token-based but might break JSON structures. A more robust approach would be to split by files:
pythonCopydef loadGraphFileChunked(path: str, file_batch: int = 10, batch_number: int = 0) -> dict:
    """
    Load a Particle Graph in file-based chunks.
    
    Args:
        path: Path/feature name to load graph for
        file_batch: Number of files per batch
        batch_number: Which batch to return (0-indexed)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Batch of files from the graph with metadata
    """
    # First get the full graph
    result = loadGraph(path)
    
    if "error" in result:
        return result
        
    # Get the full manifest
    manifest = result["manifest"]
    
    # Create a simplified manifest with just metadata
    metadata = {
        "tech_stack": manifest.get("tech_stack", {}),
        "file_count": manifest.get("file_count", 0),
        "coverage_percentage": manifest.get("coverage_percentage", 0),
    }
    
    # Get all files
    all_files = []
    for feature, feature_files in manifest.get("files", {}).items():
        for file_path, file_data in feature_files.items():
            all_files.append((feature, file_path, file_data))
    
    # Calculate total batches
    total_batches = (len(all_files) + file_batch - 1) // file_batch
    
    # Validate batch number
    if batch_number >= total_batches:
        return {"error": f"Invalid batch number. Only {total_batches} batches available."}
    
    # Get the current batch of files
    start_idx = batch_number * file_batch
    end_idx = min(start_idx + file_batch, len(all_files))
    batch_files = all_files[start_idx:end_idx]
    
    # Build the batch manifest
    batch_manifest = {
        "metadata": metadata,
        "files": {}
    }
    
    for feature, file_path, file_data in batch_files:
        if feature not in batch_manifest["files"]:
            batch_manifest["files"][feature] = {}
        batch_manifest["files"][feature][file_path] = file_data
    
    # Return the batch with metadata
    return {
        "batch": batch_manifest,
        "batch_number": batch_number,
        "total_batches": total_batches,
        "file_count_in_batch": len(batch_files),
        "token_count": len(tokenizer.encode(json.dumps(batch_manifest)))
    }
Using in Practice
In your IDE/MCP client, you would implement the chunking like this:

First call to get metadata and total batches:
CopyfirstBatch = loadGraphFileChunked("Events")
total_batches = firstBatch["total_batches"]

Then you can prompt the AI with a special format:
Copy"I'm going to load the Particle-Graph for Events in {total_batches} batches. 
Please build a complete understanding as I send them."

Send each batch and let the AI acknowledge:
Copy"Here's batch 1 of {total_batches}: {batch_data}"


This approach will let you provide the full context to the AI while working within the constraints of message size limits.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Tcan we bypass the size limits ?EditLooking at the problem more fundamentally, yes, we can likely bypass the size limits, but we need to approach it differently. The issue isn't with your Particle-Graph implementation, but rather with how the graph data is being transmitted to Claude through your IDE.
Alternative Approaches to Bypass Size Limits

Use Artifacts (Recommended):
If your IDE supports Claude's artifact capabilities, this is the best solution:
pythonCopydef exportGraphAsArtifact(path: str) -> str:
    """Export graph to a file that can be uploaded as an artifact"""
    result = loadGraph(path)
    if "error" in result:
        return {"error": result["error"]}
        
    # Write to a temporary file
    import tempfile
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.json', delete=False) as f:
        json.dump(result["manifest"], f, indent=2)
        return {"file_path": f.name}
Then upload the resulting file as an artifact to Claude.
Use a File-Based Approach:

Export the graph to a file that can be accessed by both your IDE and Claude:

pythonCopydef exportGraphToSharedFile(path: str, output_path: str = None) -> dict:
    """Export graph to a file in a shared location"""
    result = loadGraph(path)
    if "error" in result:
        return {"error": result["error"]}
        
    # Generate default output path if not provided
    if not output_path:
        output_path = f"{path.replace(',', '_')}_graph.json"
        
    # Use PathResolver to ensure correct path
    output_path = PathResolver.resolve_path(output_path)
    
    # Write the graph to the file
    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(result["manifest"], f, indent=2)
        
    return {"file_path": output_path}
Then you can instruct Claude to read this file directly.
Use Base64 Encoding:

Encode the graph as base64 to avoid any JSON parsing issues:

pythonCopydef loadGraphBase64(path: str) -> dict:
    """Load graph and return as base64 encoded string"""
    result = loadGraph(path)
    if "error" in result:
        return {"error": result["error"]}
        
    import base64
    encoded = base64.b64encode(json.dumps(result["manifest"]).encode()).decode()
    return {"base64": encoded}
Then Claude can decode this.
Dedicated API Endpoint:

Create a small web server that Claude can query directly:

pythonCopy# In a new file: graph_server.py
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from src.api.load_graph import loadGraph

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/graph/<path>')
def get_graph(path):
    result = loadGraph(path)
    return jsonify(result.get("manifest", {"error": "Failed to load graph"}))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5678)
Then Claude can make a direct HTTP request to this endpoint.

The Most Practical Solution
If your IDE supports Claude's latest features, I recommend using an artifact-based approach. This allows transmitting large files without size limitations.
If not, I'd suggest modifying your export_graph.py implementation to write the graph to a file that you can then share directly with Claude through your IDE's file upload capability.
Here's a simple enhancement to export_graph.py:
pythonCopydef exportGraph(path: str, output_format: str = "json") -> dict:
    """
    Export a graph to a file in specified format.
    
    Args:
        path: Path/feature name to export graph for
        output_format: Format to export as (json, yaml, markdown)
    
    Returns:
        dict: Path to the exported file
    """
    # Load the graph
    result = loadGraph(path)
    
    if "error" in result:
        return {"error": result["error"], "isError": True}
    
    # Generate a filename
    safe_path = path.replace(",", "_").replace("/", "_")
    file_path = f"particle_graph_{safe_path}_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.{output_format}"
    
    # Export based on format
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'w') as f:
            if output_format == "json":
                json.dump(result["manifest"], f, indent=2)
            elif output_format == "yaml":
                import yaml
                yaml.dump(result["manifest"], f)
            elif output_format == "markdown":
                # Simple markdown conversion
                f.write(f"# Particle Graph: {path}\n\n")
                f.write(f"## Technology Stack\n\n")
                # ... more markdown formatting
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Failed to export graph: {str(e)}", "isError": True}
    
    return {
        "content": [{"type": "text", "text": f"Graph exported to {file_path}"}],
        "isError": False,
        "file_path": file_path
    }
Then you can upload this file to Claude, who can parse the complete graph without truncation issues.
