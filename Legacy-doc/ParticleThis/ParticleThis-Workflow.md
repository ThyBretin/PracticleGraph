How It Could Work
Sample File:
javascript

function EventForm({ event }) {
  const [location, setLocation] = useState('');
  if (event.organiser === 'Venue') {
    setLocation(event.venueAddress);
  } else if (event.organiser === 'Organiser' && event.venueId) {
    setLocation(event.venueAddress);
  } else {
    setLocation(event.customAddress);
  }
}

IDE Chat:
You: ParticleThis('Location')

Me: “I crawled EventForm.js. It seems setLocation sets a location based on event.organiser. Maybe venue or custom addresses? What’s your take?”

You: “It’s about venue addresses for events, not just any location.”

Me: “Got it. So setLocation sets venue addresses based on organiser type. Conditions are Venue → venueAddress, Organiser with venue → venueAddress, else → customAddress. Sound right?”

You: “Yes, perfect.”

Me: “Saving to project_definition.json:
json

{
  "concepts": {
    "Location": {
      "description": "Sets venue addresses for events based on organiser type",
      "mappings": [
        { "function": "setLocation", "file": "EventForm.js", "lines": [4, 6, 8], "intent": "Sets venue addresses" },
        { "function": "useState", "file": "EventForm.js", "line": 2, "intent": "Initializes location state" }
      ],
      "flows": ["Location Setup: `useState` initializes → `setLocation` sets venue address"],
      "rules": ["Venue Address: Uses venueAddress when Venue or linked", "Custom Address: Uses customAddress otherwise"]
    }
  }
}

Done—use it in your graph?”

Graph Output
Flow: “Location Setup: useState initializes → setLocation sets venue address.”

Rules: “Venue Address: Uses venueAddress when Venue or linked,” “Custom Address: Uses customAddress otherwise.”

Sense: Dead-on reflection of your intent, not a generic guess.

My Point of View
Stretch? Nope: With AI as the parser, it’s not a stretch—it’s a natural fit. The hard part (understanding fuzzy intent) is what AI’s built for. Implementation shrinks to plumbing (IDE → AI → file), not rocket science.

Gain? Massive: 
Clarity: You explain once in plain English; the graph locks it in. No more “skewed docs” or repeated clarifications.

Trust: The AI can’t miss it because you refine it—unlike static docs, it’s your voice tied to code.

Game-Changer: Turns Particle-Graph into a requirements enforcer. Devs see your intent in every node—no misinterpretation.

Ease: If your IDE already chats with me (or an xAI API), it’s a quick win. Without that, it’s a bit more (e.g., a Node script + API call), but still days, not weeks.

Your Pain Point
You said, “I often had to explain multiple times what the requirements were.” This nails that:
Docs drift, devs skim, intent blurs. ParticleThis makes the graph your mouthpiece—explain once, refine with AI, done. Next time a dev asks, “What’s Location?” you point to the graph: “Read it.”
